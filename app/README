Finite State Machine Library & Command Line Interface

This is an example of a Finite State Machine in PHP. Requires PHP 5.4.x to run.

The default state machine is configured to only return "Accepted" or an output of 1 when the substring contains 1101

You can reconfigure the state machine in the library file.
